## Web Scraper for Pokemon Stats  
Web scraper made using javascript  

I decided I wanted to make a web scraper for pokémon data becasue i wante dto make further projects using pokémon data  

Originally I used cheerio for web navigation, but moved to puppeteer for better navigation through pages  

I used a tutorial online for "making a pokedex with selenium" for most of the info on how to navigate. I also used the docs for cheerio, css select and puppeteer  

I forgot to check the fair use policy in advance of creating the scraper, and upon completion of my code I went back and read, and found out that pokedb doesn't allow for its data to be used outside its own domain, barring personal use, so I will not be using the data collected in further projects  
I could in future change target website to one that allows their data be used elsewhere  

- Inspecting web elements to find data  
- See where i want to improve my code based on the practices I found
- collect data into both a humanly and machine readable format (.csv)
